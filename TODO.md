# TODO

- [ ] Finalize the build process for the `MilkdropConverter`.
- [ ] Implement the core translation logic in `MilkdropConverter.cpp`.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive mapping from Milkdrop built-in variables to GLSL uniforms.
- [ ] Implement a robust system for translating Milkdrop expression syntax to GLSL.
- [ ] Handle the `q` and `t` variables correctly, ensuring data flow from per-frame to per-pixel logic.
- [ ] Add support for generating UI controls (JSON annotations) for the converted shaders.
- [ ] (Stretch Goal) Investigate and implement translation for `warp` and `comp` HLSL shaders.
- [ ] (Stretch Goal) Add support for custom shapes and waves.
